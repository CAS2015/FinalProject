# FinalProject:
# Voyager's Handbook

### Description
Attention to detail is key when traveling internationally: you don't want to get stuck in customs, make a mistake about visa requirements, or forget that you're not allowed to chew gum in Singapore. Voyager's Handbook is a web app that allows a user to keep track of important information about travel requirements for various countries. With Voyager's Handbook, a user can plan trips in a "My Trips" section, and generate checklists of requirements for the countries they will be visiting. They can access vetted information entered by site administrators, and also view comments and tips left by other users. Finally, the user also can create a "Wishlist" of countries to keep in mind for future travel plans.

### Lessons Learned

* Eric: This was a great opportunity to build something from the ground up while collaborating remotely. Communication was key to avoid merge conflicts and wasted effort. We did great as a team by communicating on Slack, Trello, and Zoom. It was also great to get some more experience in Angular, along with the by-now-familiar back-end technologies.
